        <p id="introduction_2">
            The band first came together in 2010 but sadly broke up in 2016. Although it has disappointed millions of fans across the world, their music 
            <br>still lives on within the fans.

            Formation of the Band
        </h2>
        <p id="formation_of_band">
            The band formed when each of the 5 singers auditioned as a singer for a British singing competition called <em>The X Factor</em> in 2010. However, 
            <br>when none of them were selected for the role, the judges grouped them together into the band known today as <em>One Direction</em>. Together, 
            <br>they finished third in the band, which is where their careers together began.

        <p id="band_successes">
            In 2011, their debut song, <em>What Makes You Beautiful</em>, was a huge hit in UK and other parts of the world amongst their fans. After their success 
            <br>with the song, they signed with America's Columbia Records, which is an American record label owned by Sony Music Entertainment. 
            <br>They created five main albums, each of which were hits amongst their fans. In order to raise awareness for Cosmic Relief in 2013, they visited 
            <br>hospitals in Ghana, where they performed. That same year, a documentary movie about them, <em>One Direction: This Is Us</em>, was released.

            By the beginning of 2014, Zayn Malik decided that he was done being a part of the band. In fact, reports say that Zayn Malik never wanted to be a part of the band and instead perform solo but took the job because of the huge opportunity. Although he left the band, the other four members decided that they would keep the band together for another year. Their final performance was December 31, 2015, on Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve. After the final performance, the band split up for good to explore careers as solo artists. Zayn Malik states that his four ex-band members will always be his "four friends for life."
