            <li> Harry Styles (leftmost)</li>
            <li>Niall Horan (second from left)</li>

            <li>Louis Tomlinson (rightmost)</li>
        </ul>
        <p id="introduction_2">
            The band first came together in 2010 but sadly broke up in 2016. Although it has disappointed millions 
            of fans across the world, their music still lives on within the fans.

        <p id="formation_of_band">
            The band formed when each of the 5 singers auditioned as a singer for a British singing competition called "The X Factor" in
            2010. However, when none of them were selected for the role, the judges grouped them together into the band known today as 
            "One Direction."
