            By the end of 2012, the album by <em>One Direction</em> was the third best-selling album in the United States. At the same 
            time, it was also the best selling album by a group that year.

            Take Me Home
        </h3>
        <p>
            The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry noted that this album was the fourth best-selling album of 2012 
            <strong>globally!</strong> With this album, <em>One Direction</em> became the first band that had two of their albums in the 
            top five best-selling.

        <p>
            While some critics argue that this album was quite immmature for the band, it still became the number 1 best-selling 
            album of 2013, taken from a study by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry.

        <p>
            <em>One Direction</em> has gotten generally positive reviews from critics. They liked that the works were mature for them, 
            but some on the other hand say that this album was very similar to their previous album. It was the sixth best-selling album 
            of 2014; not marking their best results but still great anyways.

            <em>One Direction</em> did better with this album than with their previous one, <em>Four</em>. It was the sixth best-selling 
            album of 2015 after the leave of Zayn Malik. In U.K. in 2015, it was the second fastest-selling album, marking a great 
            accomplishment for the band before the break-up.
